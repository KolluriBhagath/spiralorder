This Python program takes a 2D matrix as input from the user and prints its elements in spiral (clockwise) order.

📋 Description
The matrix is traversed layer by layer starting from the top-left corner, moving:

➡️ Left to right (top row)

⬇️ Top to bottom (right column)

⬅️ Right to left (bottom row)

⬆️ Bottom to top (left column)

This process continues until all elements are visited.
